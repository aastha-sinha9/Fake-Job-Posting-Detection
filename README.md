# Fake Job Posting Detection

This project aims to identify fake job postings using a machine learning model trained on textual data. It includes both a backend ML model and a deployed frontend interface for user interaction.

#  Problem Statement

Fake job postings have increased across online platforms, misleading job seekers and wasting time. This project attempts to classify job descriptions as **genuine** or **fake** using natural language processing and deep learning techniques.

---

#  Features

- Preprocessed job posting dataset
- Word embedding using GloVe vectors
- Deep learning model (ANN) for binary classification
- Interactive frontend built using [Bolt AI](https://bolt.ai)
- Fully deployed frontend on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- API-ready backend (Flask or Streamlit compatible)

---

#  Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed nulls, unnecessary columns, and duplicate rows
   - Balanced the dataset if needed

2. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Tokenization, stop word removal, lowercasing
   - Embedding with `glove.6B.100d.txt` vectors

3. **Model**
   - Deep Neural Network with dense layers
   - Accuracy, precision, recall as evaluation metrics

4. **Deployment**
   - Streamlit or Flask backend (as per your final setup)
   - Frontend hosted on Netlify

---

#  Frontend Deployment

The frontend was built using **Bolt AI** and deployed via **Netlify**.

You can enter a job description and get real-time predictions from the backend.
